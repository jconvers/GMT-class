# GMT-class
GMT4 scripts for the mini-course. Clone me to get the scripts and examples

just use "git clone https://github.com/jconvers/GMT-class.git"

Keep in mind, there are some examples that will not run simply because the files that
it is using are too big to put here. for everything else, just try it.
and let me know if its all going to hell.

I will try to keep this updated and on par with the class. IF, by any chance you did not make part of this,
just send me a message and I will do my best to get you to run these examples.

Thank you!!
